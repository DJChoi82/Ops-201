# Ops-201
#Ops 201 class through Code Fellows

Hello, this repo was created for a class I am taking through Code Fellows. This class is called Ops 201 Foundations of Computer Operations. The files uploaded are scripting challenges done through the course that include Bash and PowerShell scripting. 

I am learning these skills so one day I could land a job in IT/cybersecurity.

I learned a lot in this class. I learned how to deploy Windows and Linux operating systems through a virtual environment using Virtual Box. I learned how to use remote desktop and SSH. I learned troubleshooting techniques from creating tickets to going through the troubleshooting methodology. I learned how to use the Windows tools like task scheduler and eventlog. I learned how to create backups of files and create system images. I learned how to use the terminal/command prompt and using the tool that are built in. I learned how to write scripts in Bash and PowerShell. I learned about Cloud computing. I learned about basic networking and using pfSense to run a virtual network. 

My favorite Ops Challenge was the one for class 11. This challenge was to automate endpoint configurations. This would make it very easy to setup configurations by just running the script. 

Shell scripting can be very useful when trying to do something on a large scale. A script can automatic tasks to save time. 

When I have more time, I would like to improve on the class06 ops challenge. I would like to make it more user friendly when asking for inputs. 

I would like to just learn more about shell scripting and get better at it.
